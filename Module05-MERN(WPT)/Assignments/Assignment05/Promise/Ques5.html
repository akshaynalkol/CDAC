    1. Create a Promise that resolves with the number 10 after
       3 seconds
    2. Create another Promise that resolves with the number
       20 after 5 seconds

    How can we log out the sum (30) of these two resolved values
    once, after BOTH promises successfully fulfill?

    HINT: Use Google/Documentation to help find an answer
    HINT2: You can Google for something like:
           "resolve 2 promises at the same time javascript"
    -->

    <script>
        const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(10);
            }, 3000);
        })

        const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(20);
            }, 5000);
        });

        Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(res => {
            console.log(res);
            console.log(res[0], res[1]);
            console.log(res[0] + res[1]);
        });
    </script>
