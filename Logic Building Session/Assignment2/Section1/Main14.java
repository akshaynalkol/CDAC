// Error -  incompatible types: String cannot be converted to double
//          double num = "Hello";

// Solution - Why does Java enforce data type constraints?
// In Java, constraints are restrictions or conditions that we impose on our code to ensure it behaves as expected and adheres to certain rules.
// The constraints can relate to data, control flow, and even security.
