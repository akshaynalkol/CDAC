// Solution - How does operator precedence affect the result?
// Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed in a complex expression with multiple operators.
// An operator's precedence is meaningful only if other operators with higher or lower precedence are present. 
// Expressions with higher-precedence operators are evaluated first.
