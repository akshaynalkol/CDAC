// Overview of SQL.

1) Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE? 
--> Yes, ANSI SQL recognizes the DATE data type. The DATE type is used to store dates in a format that typically includes year, month, and day, allowing for operations and comparisons on date values.

Characteristics of the DATE Data Type:
- Format: The DATE data type usually stores values in the format YYYY-MM-DD. For example, 2024-10-10 represents October 10, 2024.
- Range: The range of dates that can be represented varies by database system, but it often covers a broad span, such as from 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31.
- Operations: You can perform various operations on DATE values, including comparisons, arithmetic operations (like adding or subtracting days), and functions to extract specific components (like year, month, or day).
- Usage: The DATE type is commonly used in scenarios where you need to track events, schedules, or any time-based data.


2) Which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values in tables? 
--> The subdivision of SQL used to insert values into tables is called Data Manipulation Language (DML). DML includes a set of commands that allow users to manipulate and interact with the data stored in a database.
DML Commands:
- INSERT: Used to add new rows to a table.
- UPDATE: Used to modify existing records in a table.
- DELETE: Used to remove existing records from a table.
